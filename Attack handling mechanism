Attack Handling Mechanism In web Applications 



Web Applications Are often attacked by attackers . So how does a web applications handle those attacks and attackers ..Let's take a look Into it

1 .Handling errors-


In some types of attacks the attackers enter some malicious codes in the input fields and in error messages the web application shows him a system generated message or debug information and the attacker takes advantage of that and proceeds in his attacks . This is called bad error handling. The Application should not show in system generated message or debug report on error screen . If the Application is good at error handling then attacking it is very difficult.

2. Maintaining audit logs


In audit logs every major activity of an Application is recorded.
for example -  successful and failed Login attempts and other Authentication events
All The transactions, payments and all
Access attempts which are blocked by access control systems
Audit logs play a major role in investigating Data breaches and any other attacks as it contains records of all the major happenings of the web application .



3. Alerting  Administrators

When an Application Observes something unusual is happening it immediately Alert the Administrators.
For example - a large no. of request are being received from a single IP or User .
Request from user containing known attack strings
In these types of scenarios the application alerts the administrators so that they can take appropriate actions



4.  Reacting to attackers

Sometimes the Applications react to the attackers themselves. When there is something unusual in the application from a particular IP or user .
For Example - The web Application slows all the functionality of the website
It repeatedly Ends that user's Session, so he have to repeatedly login or do the steps again
