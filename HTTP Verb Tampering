Http Verb Tampering

So today we will talk about HTTP verb tampering , i know some people will say that it is totally waste of time to discuss about this type of vulnerability
But personally i think , one should know about it , YOU MIGHT ENCOUNTER IT SOME DAY .
Understanding verb first , Verb is nothing but the method by which you are sending the request , that can be GET, POST, PUT , DELETE etc, as the name suggests , we will be playing with the methods by which we are sending the request to the server
So basically there are some resources , which can be only accessed after the HTTP Authentication ,
So suppose , a server is configured in such a way that if a client sends a request and that request is a GET or a POST request then ask for the username and password .
Now the moment you click on the link to access that resource , your browser sends a GET request or a POST request  by default according to the functionality you need and then it ask for the username and the password .
Till this scenario , this mechanism works pretty well

looking at the configuration again , it says if a request is by a GET method or a POST method, ask for the username and password and authenticate the user
But if we make a request with any other method , other than GET or POST we can bypass the authentication because it is configured to only authenticate the GET and POST request , because a normal browser will only send a GET or POST request by default .
So when we change the method / verb it doesn't even authenticate the request . That's how we can bypass Http Authentication by tampering the verb .

To check which methods a web application allows , you can send a curl request to the host by the OPTIONS method or you can do the same thing by Metasploit modules and nmap nse scripts

Most of the servers are not vulnerable to this flaw , but still , if you are lucky enough , you might find one
