Installing
->apt install sublist3r

Searching for subdomains with sublist3r

sublist3r -d google.com
Here "-d" is for giving domains and "google.com" is the domain for which you are searching sub domains

if you its taking a lot of time then you can always increase the no. of threads working on the process
by just introducing "-t" to the command

for example -
sublist3r -d google.com  -t 100

after this command 100 threads will be working to get the subdomains

Searching Domains with crt.sh

Another way of hunting subdomains is with crt.sh
just go to this website , there is a search box and in that search box , write the  domain you want to hunt the subdomains for

So when you get a list of sub domains , there will be some subdomains which are not real or false . so filter this out  you can always give this list to an amazing tool "tomnomnom/httprobe" , its an amazing tool on github and will fliter out the false domains for you .
