How to check for / find this vulnerability??

Suppose there is a file named Rupender_Bauhtey
which is at the location - etc/hacker/Rupender_Bauhtey
so one web application is fetching is file and the URL is
- https://anyweb.com/file=Rupender_Bauhtey


so now ,
the first thing we have understood is that the ".."  are used to one directory backward in linux terminal and windows.
so in the given link if we replace Rupender_Bauhtey with ../ awe will come one directory backwards . so  we will come in hacker directory

point to be noted this will only happen if the website is vulnerable , if the website is giving an error then it is not vulnerable ..
so suppose we want to go to passwd directory which is in etc directory

so we can replace Rupender_Bauhtey with ../../passwd

and if it gives us content of the passwd directory/file than it is vulnerable otherwise it is not
