Mapping the Application by inference from public content and Brute Force Technique .

So , As we all know that bruteforce is a technique in which we test n no. of keys or values within a very short period of time by the help of a machine .
First coming to the brute force technique , it can be used to discover new possible directories of a web application .
So now the question arises how do we do that ?
As we Know that , In REST Urls most of the things after a "/" are directories
for Example - https://example.com/auth/Forgotpassword

In this example after "/" we have a directory named auth in which there is a functionality named "Forgotpassword" .
So whenever we will do bruteforce we will do it on the part only which is after the "/".
In bruteforce we will be testing hundreds and thousands of the directory locations by testing each and every location present in the list .
This is done by many spidering softwares itself , the test a directory location and then save the responses given by the server .
Then out of those results we have to filter out the responses
the responses which we got from the successful requests,
To check if the responses have some real pages or not . Check the content length, Sometimes the response codes can mislead you . So check for the content length , the responses which actually have valid pages sent by the server will have bigger content length than the other ones which are not having any content page.

BY THIS TECHNIQUE SOMETIMES WE FIND THE FUNCTIONALITIES OR DIRECTORIES WHICH ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE SHOWN BY THE SERVER OR WEB APPLICATIONS.
