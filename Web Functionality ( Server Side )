Web Functionality (Server Side)


Server Side Functionality-
Earlier world wide web contained static content . The website consists of various resources like images and HTML pages . They were simply loaded in the web server and delivered when any user requested it.
But nowadays a lot of content is dynamic . it is created on the fly . if two users have requested the same page , they both will not get the same results as they might have different privileges and many other things . The content is customized for that particular user or client.
The dynamic delivered to the user is generated by scripts and codes . These scripts and codes receive inputs from the client , then they process it and then return the output to the respective client.
The inputs are mainly taken by 4 ways

1. From the URL's (the query string or the Rest style URLs)
2. In HTTP cookies
3. The body of the request

These are the primary sources of the input. but the server can use any part of the HTTP Request for an input ..like the User agent header to know about the browser and make the requested page compatible with it..

Web servers use different technologies to perform different tasks
like
for scripting - php , perl
web application platform - java , asp.net
web server - Apache , IIS , Netscape
Databases - MySQL and MS-SQL


This is the basic introduction to how web-server functions.
