Information Gathering 

Domain-

First of all you should know which domain you are going to do testing . Knowing the domain is very important as it is the platform on which you are going to deploy all your attacks and scans.

Discovering Subdomains-
Sometimes the main domain is safe but its children sub-domains have vulnerabilities , and those vulnerabilities in sub-domains can be the reason for security breaches in the main domain . So yes discovering sub domains is an important step in web app pentesting. After that rank those sub-domains on the basis of unpopularity as the less popular subdomains have more chances of having vulnerabilities.

ways to find open ports and services -
nmap IP address
In case server is blocking ping request - nmap IP address -Pn
For Aggressive Scanning - nmap IP Address -sV
For Detailed Information - nmap Ip Address | nmap -sC IP Address
